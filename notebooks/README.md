# Usage instruction
In order, to run the [Data_collection.ipynb](./Data_collection.ipynb) notebook, you will need to download the raw data from the [DNCP website](https://www.contrataciones.gov.py/datos/adjudicaciones) and placed in the [raw_data folder](../data/raw_data/).

We named each folder as "DNCP_Adjudicaciones_*year*" after downloading, depending on the the year of the data it contained. Ex.: folder with data of 2020, was named "DNCP_Adjudicaciones_2020".
