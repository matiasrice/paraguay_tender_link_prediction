# Where to download the data?

In order to fill this folder, go and download the raw data from the [DNCP website](https://www.contrataciones.gov.py/datos/adjudicaciones).
- We named each folder as "DNCP_Adjudicaciones_*year*" after downloading, depending on the the year of the data it contained. Ex.: folder with data of 2020, was named "DNCP_Adjudicaciones_2020".
